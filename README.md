# RoughInvestmentReturns

A simple script to get a rough idea of the returns from an investment.

It takes the _invested_ amount, and divides it equally among each _month_ of the duration of the investment.

It then calculates the IRR on this.

Useful to compare returns against an instrument like, say, recurring deposits.
